# Work Experience

## Product Manager
### Superpedestrian
### Embedded Systems, R&D, AI
* Specified, planned, and prioritized work across three independent teams (Research & Development, Embedded Systems, Embedded Test) to integrate new technology and bring to market
* Translated problem statements from operations teams into feature specifications 
* Communicated critical technical topics to non-technical teams throughout the organization
* Scoped and scheduled engineering feature development to support high profile technology demos
#### Key Achievements: Led entire new product introduction process of high accuracy location technology for LEVs (from company partner acquisition through system integration and launch). Directed technology demo, resulting in winning high-value permit to operate in Chicago, IL.

## Associate Product Manager 
### Embedded Systems
* Introduced documentation and process for feature development 
* Managed new team integration to company post-acquisition (acquired R&D department)
* Groomed software task backlog and specified new work specifically in support of cross-team integration 
* Continued improvement of test report generation and analytics
#### Key Achievement: Standardized new feature integration process across hardware and software teams.

## Test Engineer
### Embedded Systems
* Developed and maintained hardware-in-the-loop test fixture and software tests for smart LEV platform 
* Built document-based manufacturing test database and supporting ETL processes 
* Managed vehicle firmware release process (performance testing and validation, engineering change orders, etc.)
* Designed and specified manufacturing test fixture to support offline firmware updates during final assembly 
* Streamlined communications and troubleshot manufacturing issues with partners in China 
#### Key Achievements: Increased fault injection and stability test coverage by over 10x. Improved throughput of electronics manufacturing line by 35% through cycle time reduction analysis using test database.
